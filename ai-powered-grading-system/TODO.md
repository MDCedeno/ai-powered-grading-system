# AI-Powered Grading System - Project TODO

## Project Overview

AI-powered grading system with PHP backend, MySQL database, and web frontend for managing users (Super Admin, MIS Admin, Professors, Students), courses, grades, and system logs.

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Database Folder Review & Fixes

- [x] Fixed database connection inconsistency (added $pdo = $conn in db.php)
- [x] Created missing create_tables.php and seed_tables.php functions
- [x] Fixed LogSeeder.php class name and content (was duplicating UserSeeder)
- [x] Fixed backup_tables.php $pdo scope and anonymous function compatibility
- [x] Verified all database creation scripts, migrations, seeders, and utility functions

### Test Folder Review & Fixes

- [x] Reviewed existing test scripts in /test folder
- [x] Identified test coverage: database checks, API endpoints, SuperAdmin functionality
- [x] Fixed path issues in test files (relative paths incorrect)
- [x] Fixed incorrect method names in test_controllers_thorough.php
- [x] Fixed incorrect endpoint paths in test_api_thorough.php
- [x] Updated check_tables.php to include all tables

## Pending Tasks ðŸ“‹

### Critical-Path Testing (Backend & Database)

- [x] Fixed API routing path extraction logic in backend/routes/api.php
- [x] Verified API endpoint responses (basic functionality) - all endpoints returning HTTP 200
- [x] Test SuperAdmin controller functionality - getAllUsers, getSystemLogs, deactivateUser all working

### Thorough Testing (Full System)

- [ ] Frontend UI interaction and backend integration tests
- [ ] Edge cases and error handling in API endpoints
- [ ] Authentication and authorization flow testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Performance and load testing

### Improvements & Enhancements

- [ ] Standardize test file paths and structure
- [ ] Add more comprehensive test coverage (unit tests, integration tests)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Add input validation and security measures
- [ ] Optimize database queries and API responses

### Documentation

- [ ] Update README.md with setup and testing instructions
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Add code comments and inline documentation
- [ ] Create deployment guide

## Current Status

- Database folder: âœ… Functional and aligned
- Test folder: âœ… Reviewed and fixed, ready for execution
- Next Priority: Execute critical-path tests to verify backend functionality

## Notes

- All database operations (create, seed, backup, restore, truncate, reset) are now working
- Test scripts have been fixed and are ready for execution
- Frontend integration testing pending after backend verification
