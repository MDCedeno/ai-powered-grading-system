# Database Folder Review and Fixes - AI Powered Grading System

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Database Configuration
- Fixed inconsistent database connection variable naming
- Updated `backend/config/db.php` to define `$pdo = $conn` for consistency

### Missing Function Files
- Created `backend/database/functions/create_tables.php` - runs all table creation migrations
- Created `backend/database/functions/seed_tables.php` - runs all data seeders

### Schema Alignment
- Updated `backend/database/creations/2024_06_01_000002_create_courses_table.php`:
  - Changed `code` to `course_code`
  - Changed `name` to `course_name`
  - Changed `schedule` to separate `semester` and `year` columns
  - Changed `faculty_id` to `professor_id`

### Model Updates
- Updated `backend/models/course.php` methods to match new schema:
  - `create()`: uses `course_code`, `course_name`, `professor_id`, `semester`, `year`
  - `update()`: uses new column names
  - `findByCode()`: searches by `course_code`
  - `getByFaculty()`: renamed to `getByProfessor()` using `professor_id`

### Seeder Fixes
- Fixed `backend/database/seeders/LogSeeder.php` - was incorrectly named UserSeeder, now properly seeds log entries

## Pending Tasks ⏳

### Testing (Requires Database Access)
- Test `reset_all.php` functionality (drop + create + seed)
- Test individual migrations in `migrations/` folder
- Test seeders individually
- Test database functions (backup, restore, truncate, drop)
- Test API endpoints for data integrity
- Verify foreign key relationships between tables

### Verification
- Ensure all table schemas match model expectations
- Verify seeder data is consistent with table constraints
- Check that all required indexes and constraints are in place

## Notes
- All database files now use consistent `$pdo` variable
- Table schemas are aligned with model methods and seeder data
- The system is ready for testing once database access is granted
- Backup functionality exists but should be tested carefully
